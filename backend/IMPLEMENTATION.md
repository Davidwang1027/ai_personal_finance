# Go Backend Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Go backend of the AI Personal Finance application using Plaid API integration.

## Architecture

```

├── config/ (configuration management)
├── db/ (database interactions)
├── handlers/ (API endpoints)
├── middleware/ (authentication, logging)
├── models/ (data structures)
├── plaid/ (Plaid API integration)
└── main.go (entry point)
```

## Core Components

### Configuration (config/)
- ~~Environment variables for Plaid API keys~~ ✅
- ~~Database connection configuration~~ ✅
- ~~Server settings~~ ✅

### Database Layer (db/)
- ~~PostgreSQL connection setup~~ ✅
- ~~Tables for:~~ ✅
  - ~~Users~~ ✅
  - ~~Items (Plaid items - linked bank accounts)~~ ✅
  - ~~Accounts~~ ✅
  - ~~Transactions~~ ✅
  - ~~Plaid API events (logging responses)~~ ✅
  - ~~Link events (logging Link interactions)~~ ✅

### Plaid Integration (plaid/)
- ~~Create Link tokens~~ ✅
- ~~Exchange public tokens for access tokens~~ ✅
- ~~Fetch transactions~~ ✅
- ~~Handle webhook events~~ ✅
- ~~Account balance retrieval~~ ✅
- ~~Error handling~~ ✅

### API Handlers (handlers/)
- User authentication
- ~~Link token creation~~ ✅
- ~~Public token exchange~~ ✅
- ~~Transaction fetching~~ ✅
- ~~Account management~~ ✅
- ~~Webhook processing~~ ✅

## Implementation Steps

1. ~~**Setup Plaid Client**~~ ✅
   - ~~Initialize plaid-go client with credentials~~ ✅
   - ~~Configure environment (sandbox/development/production)~~ ✅

2. ~~**Database Schema**~~ ✅
   - ~~User table~~ ✅
   - ~~Items table (store access_tokens securely)~~ ✅
   - ~~Accounts table~~ ✅
   - ~~Transactions table~~ ✅
   - ~~Event logging tables~~ ✅

3. ~~**Core API Endpoints**~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/create_link_token` - Generate token for Plaid Link~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/exchange_public_token` - Exchange public token~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/transactions` - Fetch user transactions~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/accounts` - Get user accounts~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/item` - Get item information~~ ✅
   - ~~`/api/plaid/webhook` - Handle Plaid webhooks~~ ✅

4. ~~**Webhook Implementation**~~ ✅
   - ~~Transaction updates~~ ✅
   - ~~Item status changes~~ ✅
   - ~~Error handling~~ ✅

5. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT or session-based auth
   - Secure storage of Plaid access tokens
   - HTTPS configuration

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Plaid client integration
- [x] Basic API endpoints (create_link_token, exchange_public_token, accounts)
- [x] Advanced API endpoints (transactions, item info, webhooks)
- [x] Unit tests for all Plaid client methods and handlers
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Database connection and models
- [x] Repository implementation for database operations

### In Progress
